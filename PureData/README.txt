There was some trouble with getting PureData patches to work over Git. I think this was the issue when Kalvin played it. I got it to work on his computer previously, but only by manually installing the patch.

I have included the PD files I use here. There are some things in the patch that I didn't end up getting to use, so it is a little unnecessarily cluttered.
